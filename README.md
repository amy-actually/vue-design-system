# Feathers Design System

**Feathers Design System** is an open source tool for building UI Design Systems with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It provides our team a set of organized tools, patterns & practices that work as the foundation for your application development.

The tool is built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), and [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo) and is aimed for designers and front-end developers who have at least basic knowledge of component based workflows + HTML, SCSS & JavaScript.
